2025-12-01 08:15:00  Phishing email observed sent to j.smith (WIN10-CLT21), URL in the body pointing to “secure-office-login[.]com”. SRC IP 145.22.81.17.
08:18:33Z User clicked the link https://secure-office-login.com/auth → redirected to credential stealing page (185.91.12.44)
08:19:25 login attempt made to O365 – same user creds used from IP 185.91.12.44, UA looked like Chrome but weird version string.
08:19:46 Sentinel generated an “Impossible Travel” alert but user dismissed the MFA notification as accidental. Ticket opened.
2025-12-01T08:20:40 download of suspicious binary “update-service.exe” from cdn-officeupdate[.]com/tool.exe – executed on WIn10-clt21.
08:21 Defender ATP raised a “Potentially malicious download” alert but status stayed “investigating” due to low severity tagging.
08:22:05 malware seems to have persistence (registry Run)... connections going out to 91.200.20.9 over 443. (possible C2)
Approx 08:23 SOC analyst checked processes on WIN10-CLT21, saw update-service.exe but thought it was a legit Windows update svc.
Approx 08:25 update-service.exe spawned “netenum.exe” which started enumerating AD, DC’s, users etc on the client workstation.
08:26 Suspicious Kerberos auth patterns detected, escalated to Tier2 for further review. Waiting on Tier3.
08:27 svc-admin token used (unknown method) and privsvc.exe launched on DC-SERVER01. Looks like DA now??? 
08:29 Tier2 requested memory dump from WIN10-CLT21 but host reboot scheduled by user for “performance issues”.
08:30 Full directory dump executed (ldapdump.ps1) running from DC-SERVER01. Output staged on client share \\WIN10-CLT21\staging.
08:31 DLP flagged unusual access to AD object paths but policy was in “audit only” mode.
08:33 Data compressed: ad-dump-20251201.zip in C:\ProgramData\Temp\ – staging for exfil.
08:34 Escalation to incident commander after detection of DA privilege usage. Containment plan initiated.
08:35-ish Zip exfil via HTTPS to https://c2-data-sync.net/upload using 91.200.20.9 – confirmed outbound bytes ↑
08:36 Incident commander ordered network isolation; WIN10-CLT21 isolated via EDR API (status appears partially contained).
08:39 Firewall rule pushed to block outbound TLS to 91.200.20.0/24 (late implementation).
08:44 Attack chain observed end-to-end; incident priority raised to P1 and forensics team requested.
